	<h3> Professional Life ‚úèÔ∏è </h3>

	<p> I am a junior at <a href="http://www.actvf.org/">Tvf</a>. I don't have any internships or a job. I have zero clue what college I'm going to go to but hopefully it'll be a good one.</p> 

	<h3> Personal Life üé∂ </h3>

	<p>I live in Manhattan and Queens. I have a dog named Sprite who I've had since 2nd grade. My main hobby is music even though I can't play any instruments. I enjoy listening to music and going to concerts. I like art - painting, drawing, color. I also like reading but I don't do it much since I can't concentrate at all. My favorite and only sport I do is snowboarding. I waste most of my time watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a> or shows.    </p>

	<h3> Technology üì∏ </h3>

	<p>I am always on my phone because I can't stop talking to my friends. I use my laptop to watch <a href="https://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a> or do homework. </p>

	<h4>Two Truths One Lie üêπ </h4>
	<p> Two of these things are true about me while one is a lie </p>
	<ul>
		<li>I have been to 17 states</li>
		<li>I broke my leg by jumping off my roof</li>
		<li>I hate school</li>
	</ul>


	<h4>Top 5 Tv Shows üñ• </h4>
	<p> My favorite five shows in no order </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Shameless</li>
		<li>Catfish</li>
		<li>The Get Down</li>
		<li>Freaks and Geeks</li>
		<li>Black Mirror</li>
	</ul>
